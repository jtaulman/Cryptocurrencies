# Cryptocurrencies

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to use unsupervised machine learning to simplify the data of different Cryptocurrencies. Once the data is simplified it will be presented using different tables, charts and graphs.

## Results

### Step 1
- Adjust the columns and remove the unneeded data for PCA.

### Step 2
- Use PCA to reduce the dimensions of the data

### Step 3
- Put the data into different clusters with KMeans.
- Started with a K=1, but then put K=4

### Step 4
- Take the clustered and reduced data to create final visualizations.

## Summary

There is a 3D scatter plot, table, and 2D scatter plot to describe each topic. The topics include the clustered_df, tradable cryptocurrencies, and the clustered data.
